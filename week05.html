        <h1>Programming Lisp Course Page - Week 5</h1>

        <h3>Read <i>Land of Lisp</i>, pages 67 through 84.</h3>

        <p>While you are reading, you should be sitting at your computer and running the examples in the book. Your major task this week is to understand fully this code.</p>
            
        <p>Your main objective is to understand the code. This style of coding is known as 'applicative programming.' It's based on the facts that (1) each function returns some value that the calling function uses, and (2) you can map through a list and perform the same action on each item of the list. <b>It is critical that you understand what is going on with these functions.</b> Later on, you will be dealing with very complicated data structures, and you should be able to picture in your mind's eye how the functions that operate on these structures work. One good way to work through this is to take a function and its arguments and work each step out by hand. Later on, you will see that Lisp has a <code>(step)</code> function that automates this, but before you use this utility you need to understand how stepping through a function by hand works.</p>

        <p>This week's game is a text adventure game. The player explores an unknown environment through text commands. There is one path to winning the game, and multiple paths to losing the game. The player's task is to win the game. Unfortunately, this game is a very simple one. However, these techniques can be used to create much bigger games. In fact, this is what we will do in Chapter 8.</p>

        <p>The requirements are given on page 69. Before you start writing the code, give some thought to analysis and design. It will be helpful if you write down the requirements, and then write down a design.</p>


        <p>In terms of implementation, this week you will mostly deal with data, and manipulate data. You will also see examples of functions calling functions and returning functions as values. It's not important at this stage that you understand how this works, but it is very important that you understand the details of the code. Your main objective this will is to understand how you can write a program to deal with data.</p>
