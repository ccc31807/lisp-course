        <h1>Programming Lisp Course Page - Week 0</h1>

        <h3>Learning the DOS Shell</h3>

        <p><b>First</b>, you must learn how to use the DOS shell, also known as the &apos;command prompt&apos;. When you invoke the command prompt, you can type commands for the machine to execute. Enter the following commands to see what they do:
            <ul>
                <li><code class="code">dir</code> press ENTER</li>
                <li><code class="code">date</code> press ENTER twice</li>
                <li><code class="code">time</code> press ENTER twice</li>
                <li><code class="code">help</code> press ENTER</li>
                <li><code class="code">help &gt; help.txt</code> press ENTER, the &apos;&gt;&apos; is the redirection operator and it sends the output of the command to the file. My help file looks like <a href="help.txt">this</a>. I have marked some commands with asterisks, you should learn how to use these. Try entering <code class="code">help dir</code> to learn more about the <code class="code">dir</code> command.</li>
            </ul>
            After you have done this, you can use the DOS commands to create a directory for this course. <code class="code">cd</code> to a convenient location on your computer, <code class="code">mkdir</code> a new directory, and <code class="code">cd</code> to it just to make sure that you can do this. This is where you will place the programs you write and where you will execute them.</p>

        <h3>Getting Common Lisp</h3>

            <p><b>Second</b>, you must get the <code>clisp</code> Common Lisp program. Go to <a href="http://www.clisp.org/">http://www.clisp.org/</a> and download the program. You will probably want the win32 distribution, found on the right side of the page. Install the program.</p>

        <h3>Getting a text editor</h3>

            <p><b>Third</b>, you must get some kind of Lisp-aware text editor. I have used Notepad++, found at <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a>. Download it and install it.</p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>

            <p><b>Fourth</b>, test what you have done to see if it works. Here is a <a href="week0.png">screen shot</a> of what this looks like on my computer.</p>

        <h3>Homework</h3>

            <p><b>Homework</b>: Yes, you have homework. The good news is that it's not graded. The bad news is that it will require you to think. If your Lisp interpreter crashes or you get an error, correct it by &apos;:q&apos; (COLON QUE), &apos;:a&apos; (COLON AIGH), or CONTROL-BREAK, or CONTROL-C.</p>

            <p>To EXIT from clisp, enter <code class="code">(quit)</code>. This is the word &apos;QUIT&apos; inside a pair of parentheses.</p>
