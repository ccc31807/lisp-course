        <h1>Programming Lisp Course Page - Week 3</h1>

        <h3>Read <i>Land of Lisp</i>, pages 31 through 45.</h3>

        <p>While you are reading, you should be sitting at your computer and running the examples in the book. See if you can figure out how they work and what they do.</p>
            
            <p>This chapter has a lot of material, and you will have to read it many times over a period of months to really understand it. Just read it for now, you don't need to study it or try to understand it all. You will come to understand most of it in the next few months, and you can come back and read it again.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>What is language syntax? This is true for all languages, whether English, Hindu, Java, or Lisp.</li>
            <li>What is language semantics? This is also true with human languages and computer languages.</li>
            <li>What is a symbol? All languages have symbols. In English, they are known as <i>words</i>. `Mother,' `father,' `dog,' and `cat' are all symbols --- that is, they stand for something else.</li>
            <li>What are numbers?</li>
            <li>What are strings?</li>
            <li>What are cons cells? There is a direct relation between a computer's memory and CPU (central processing unit). A CPU contains registers, and in older computers, two of them were sometimes known as the `address register' and the `decrement register.' These registers read from memory and wrote to memory. When the CPU processed data, it processed what was called the `contents of address register' or `contests of decrement register.' The Contents of the Address Register was referred to as CAR, and the Contents of the Decrement Register was referred to as CDR. When you thing about <code>(car x)</code> and <code>(cdr y)</code>, you can think about the contents of these memory locations going into the CPU to be processed by the computer.</li>
