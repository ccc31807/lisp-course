# LISP-COURSE

This contains a large portion of the programming course I taught for Middle School age students (approximately 12 through 15). I taught the language Common Lisp for several reasons. Three big reasons were (1) Lisp's very simple syntax, (2) Lisp's logical transparancy, and (3) the very attractive book Conrad Barski wrote, *Land of Lisp*.

Unfortunately, on about the first third of the course is complete. I did not get to the last third because of time constraints. Perhaps I'll make an effort to add the content to the second third as and when I have time.

My primary purpose was not to teach a programming language, but to teach **hot to prograqm**, a very different subject. The outcome of this effort was gratifying. We were able to spend a lot of time on things that don't get much attention in a typical first programming course, such as logic, the inner workings of the machine's CPU and memory, recursion, functional programming, and algorithms. Too, the students (not knowing any better) accepting Common Lisp enthusiastically as a programming language.
