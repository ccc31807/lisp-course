\lstset{language=Lisp}

Invoke clisp and type the following commands. Remember, a `:q' (COLON QUE), `:a' (COLON AIGH), CONTROL-BREAK, or CONTROL-C will restore the top level prompt if you make a mistake. This explores the Lisp functions, \texttt{(minusp), (zerop), (plusp), (evenp), (oddp), (rem), (mod), (random), and (ash)}. Write down each result and see if you can figure out what each one does.

Functions that end in the letter ``p'' are called \textit{predicates}. Predicates return either TRUE or FALSE. This homework also includes the remainder (or modulus) operations. \texttt{(random)} is a random number generator, useful for games of chance. \texttt{(ash)} is the arithmetic shift function. It takes two arguments, the number to be shifted, and a number indicating the amount to shift -- to the left for a positive amount, and to the right for a negative number -- effectively doubling or halving the number given as the first argument.
