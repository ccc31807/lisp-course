\maketitle{}

\paragraph{}Copy the file \texttt{(guess.lisp)}, and rename the file to create a new test, call it \texttt{my-guess.lisp}, to allow the computer to pick a number for you to guess. Go through the analysis and design phases. A little thought before hand will save you a lot of work later on.

\paragraph{} Before you make any changes, think about the requirements of the new program, and design the changes. In other words, do the analysis and design phases. After you make the changes, test your new program to see if it meets the requirements.
