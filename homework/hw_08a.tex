\paragraph{}Go to \url{http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php}, download graphviz, and install it on your machine.

\paragraph{}After installation, look at your directory structure (using your Windows explorer or whatever tool you use) to see how graphviz is installed. My directory looks like this: \texttt{c:\textbackslash{}Program Files (x86)\textbackslash{}Graphviz2.34}. Look at the \texttt{bin} directory and you will see a number of executable programs. We will be working with \texttt{dot.exe}, \texttt{neato.exe}, and \texttt{circo.exe}. You are welcome to experiment with any others you want to, but we will only be uning these three.

\paragraph{}Now, look at the \texttt{share} directory. Mine is at \texttt{Graphviz2.34\textbackslash{}share\textbackslash{}graphviz\textbackslash{}doc\textbackslash{}pdf}. Below is a screenshot of my machine. Read `dotguide.pdf' and, if you have the time and energy, at least look at the first page of `dot1.pdf.' You may also want to browse some of the other PDFs that look interesting to you.

\paragraph{}Your biggest challenge may be getting these commands to work. Tomorrow, I will discuss this and give you three options.
