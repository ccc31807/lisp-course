This week, we are going to build a game called Hangman. The game requires two players, one chooses a word or phrase, and the other tries to guess the word one character at the time. The first playert writes the word or phrase, replacing the alphabetical characters with underscores. As the second player guesses characters, the first player either replaces the underscore with the character if the character appears in the word or phrase, or adds the character to a list if the character does not appear in the word or phrase. The second player (typically) has six attempts to guess the word or phrase. Your assignment is to write a computer program that allows two players to play Hangman.

Unfortunately, because of the technology of the command line, this will not be a complete game, as you will see. In several weeks, we will be able to write the complete game. For now, you can write enough to at least test it and see that it works properly.

Remember the software development process. What is the first thing you should do? Determine the requirements of the program. Your assignment for today is simplh to play several games of Hangman, carefully noting the steps. Write down all the steps. This will constitute your requirements specification.
