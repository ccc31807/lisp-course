Copy the file \texttt{(add-test.lisp)}, and rename the file to create a new test, call it \texttt{add-test-two.lisp}, to give five questions with problems between 0 and 50. What did you have to change?

 Before you make any changes, think about the requirements of the new program, and design the changes. In other words, do the analysis and design phases. After you make the changes, test your new program to see if it meets the requirements.
