\maketitle{}

\paragraph{}This builds on the tester you worked on yesterday. This is much easier, but you still have to think. You only have to change one little thing.

\paragraph{}Alter the program to print the student's score at the end of the test. There's probably only one best way to do this. I have copied it below. The answer is $100 \times \frac{total-correct}{total-questions}$. You just have to figure out where to put it. Don't worry about \texttt{(format)}. I know you don't understand it, but we will have a week on it a little later and you will understand it them.

\lstset{language=Lisp,numbers=left,keepspaces=false,basicstyle=\small,numberstyle=\tiny,breaklines=true,showstringspaces=false}
\begin{lstlisting}
(defun give-test (items)
      (cond
 ;B change to add condition
 ;C change to print the number correct after the test
        ((or (>= current-question total-questions) (null items)) 
         ;;D changed to print the student's score at the end of the test.
         (format t "Test over, you got ~a correct and made a ~d.~%" total-correct (* 100 (/ total-correct total-questions))) nil)
        (t (let* ((len (length items))
                  (num (random len)))
             (ask-question (nth num items))
             (give-test (remove (nth num items) items))))))
