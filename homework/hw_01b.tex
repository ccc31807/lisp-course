\title{Homework, Week 1, part B}

\maketitle{}

The software development process has four steps. This week's homework will walk you through all four steps. The steps are: (1) analysis, (2) design, (3) implementation, and (4) testing. The process repeats all four steps, one after another, many times before the software is complete.

The purpose of implementation is to write the software using the design. I have copied a simple addition test program below. Copy this into a file named ``add-test.lisp'', load it into your clisp environment, and run it.

You do not have to know what this does. This short code has seven variables. You should understand what each variable does. They are: number-of-questions, number-correct, question-counter, a, b, c, and d. Do an internet search for ``common lisp function defparameter'' and ``common lisp function let.''

\lstset{language=Lisp,numbers=left,keepspaces=true,basicstyle=\small,numberstyle=\tiny,showstringspaces=false,breaklines=true}
\begin{lstlisting}
;;;add-test.lisp

(print "This is add-lisp. Evaluate (start-test) to start the test.")

(defun start-test ()
  (defparameter number-of-questions 10)
  (defparameter number-correct 0)
  (defparameter question-counter 1)
  (format t "Starting the addition test, you have ~a questions.~%" number-of-questions)
  (run-test))

(defun addition-problem ()
  (let* ((a (random 11))
         (b (random 11))
         (c (+ a b))
         (d (read (format t "What is ~a + ~a? " a b))))
    (cond ((= c d)
           (format t "Correct~%")
            1)
          (t (format t "The answer is ~a~%" c)
              0))))

(defun run-test ()
    (cond 
      ((zerop number-of-questions)
       (format t "You got ~a correct and made a ~a.~%" number-correct (* 100 (/ number-correct 10.0))))
      (t (format t "Question ~a. " question-counter)
         (decf number-of-questions)
         (incf number-correct (addition-problem))
		 (incf question-counter)
         (run-test))))
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Testing}Load this file into your lisp with \texttt{(load "add-test.lisp")} and evaluate \texttt{(start-test)}. Does it do what it is supposed to do? Does it meet all the requirements you identified? Does it do anything that you did not identify as a requirement?
