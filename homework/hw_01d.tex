\maketitle{}

\paragraph{}This homework is harder. It might take you an hour or two to complete. If you can't complete it, just think about it.

\paragraph{}Change the file \texttt{(add-test.lisp)} to create a new test, call it \texttt{multiply-test.lisp}, to give ten questions with multiplication problems between 1 and 12. This is a little harder. Hint: evaluate \texttt{(random 12)} many times. Does it ever return 0? Does it ever return 12? Is this a problem? What do you need to do to change it? After you change it, does the program work correctly?

\paragraph{}Before you start writing code, do the analysis and design. When you finish writing the code, do the testing. A little thought before you begin will save you a lot of work later on.
