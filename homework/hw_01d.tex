This homework is harder. It might take you an hour or two to complete. If you can't complete it, just think about it.

Change the file \texttt{(add-test.lisp)} to create a new test, call it \texttt{multiply-test.lisp}, to give ten questions with multiplication problems between 1 and 12. This is a little harder. Hint: evaluate \texttt{(random 12)} many times. Does it ever return 0? Does it ever return 12? Is this a problem? What do you need to do to change it? After you change it, does the program work correctly?

Before you start writing code, do the analysis and design. When you finish writing the code, do the testing. A little thought before you begin will save you a lot of work later on.
