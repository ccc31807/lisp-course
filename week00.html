        <h1>Programming Lisp Course Page - Week 0</h1>

        <h3>Learning the DOS Shell</h3>

		<p><b>First</b>, you must learn how to use the DOS shell, also known as the &apos;command prompt&apos;. One way to invoke tbe command prompt is to press &lt;CTRL-ESC&gt;, type <code>cmd</code> in the run box, and press &lt;ENTER&gt;. When you invoke the command prompt, you can type commands for the machine to execute. Enter the following commands to see what they do:
            <ul>
                <li><code class="code">dir</code> press ENTER</li>
                <li><code class="code">date</code> press ENTER twice</li>
                <li><code class="code">time</code> press ENTER twice</li>
                <li><code class="code">help</code> press ENTER</li>
                <li><code class="code">help &gt; help.txt</code> press ENTER, the &apos;&gt;&apos; is the redirection operator and it sends the output of the command to the file. My help file looks like <a href="help.txt" target="_blank">this</a>. I have marked some commands with asterisks, you should learn how to use these. Try entering <code class="code">help dir</code> to learn more about the <code class="code">dir</code> command.</li>
                <li><code class="code">exit</code> press ENTER</li>
            </ul>
            After you have done this, you can use the DOS commands to create a directory for this course. <code class="code">cd</code> to a convenient location on your computer, <code class="code">mkdir</code> a new directory, and <code class="code">cd</code> to it just to make sure that you can do this. This is where you will place the programs you write and where you will execute them.</p>

        <h3>Getting Common Lisp</h3>

            <p><b>Second</b>, you must get the <code>clisp</code> Common Lisp program. Go to <a href="http://www.clisp.org/" target="_blank">http://www.clisp.org/</a> and download the program. You will probably want the win32 distribution, found on the right side of the page. Install the program.</p>

        <h3>Getting a text editor</h3>

            <p><b>Third</b>, you must get some kind of Lisp-aware text editor. I have used Notepad++, found at <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a>, and found that it works well. Download it and install it.</p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>

            <p><b>Fourth</b>, test what you have done to see if it works. Here is a <a href="week0.png" target="_blank">screen shot</a> of what this looks like on my computer.</p>

			<p>Here is your first program. Open a new file, type  the following in the file: <code>(defun hello () (print "Hello"))</code>, and save it as <code>hi.lisp</code>. It should be in the same directory where you are running your lisp. Then, in your lisp, run this command to load the file: <code>(load "hi.lisp")</code>. After the file loads, run the program by giving this command: <code>(hello)</code>. You have just written, loaded, and run a computer program.

        <h3>Homework</h3>

            <p><b>Homework</b>: Yes, you have homework. The good news is that it's not graded. The bad news is that you will have to turn it in. If your Lisp interpreter crashes or you get an error, correct it by &apos;:q&apos; (COLON QUE), &apos;:a&apos; (COLON AIGH), or CONTROL-BREAK, or CONTROL-C.</p>

<p>The <code>(dribble)</code> command sends output to a named file as well as to the screen. To start dribble, give the command with a file name. This will create a file in the same directory where you are running your Lisp. The dribble command without a filename turns the dribble off. Name your file with your initials, the date in YYMMDD format, and the homework assignment, with a ".txt" extension. For example, my first homework file would be named <code>ccc-160630-hw_00a.txt</code>. Here is an example:

		<ol>
			<li><code>(dribble "ccc-160630-hw_00a.txt")</code></li>
			<li><code>(+ 2 4 6 8)</code></li>
			<li><code>(dribble)</code></li>
		</ol>

            <p>To EXIT from clisp, enter <code class="code">(quit)</code>. This is the word &apos;QUIT&apos; inside a pair of parentheses.</p>
            <ol>

                <li><a href="homework/hw_00b.pdf" target="_blank">homework/hw_00b.pdf</a></li>
                <li><a href="homework/hw_00c.pdf" target="_blank">homework/hw_00c.pdf</a></li>
                <li><a href="homework/hw_00d.pdf" target="_blank">homework/hw_00d.pdf</a></li>
             <ol>
