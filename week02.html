        <h1>Programming Lisp Course Page - Week 2</h1>

        <h3>Read <i>Land of Lisp</i>, pages 15 through 30.</h3>

        <p>While you are reading, you should be sitting at your computer and running the examples in the book. See if you can figure out how they work and what they do.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>What is a variable? (see below)</li>
            <li>What is a global variable? (page 23)</li>
            <li>What is a lexical (local) variable? (page 28)</li>
            <li>What is a function? (see below)</li>
            <li>What is a global function? (page 25)</li>
            <li>What is a lexical (local) function? (page 28)</li>
            <li style="color: #ff0000;">Barski states on page 25 that ``Every command in Command Lisp generates a return value.'' What does this mean?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Review</h3>

        <p>Software development process:
            <ol>
                <li>Analysis: what the software should do, developing functional requirements</li>
                <li>Design: how the software should work, using the requirements as a guide</li>
                <li>Implementation: writing the design in some computer language</li>
                <li>Testing: does the software meet the requirements?</li>
            </ol>
            This is an iterative process, which means that it is repeated over and over, with the Testing phase feeding back into the Analysis phase.</p>

        <p>Reading the book: Students are responsible for reading and understanding the book, not the instructor. Read the assigned pages multiple times. Read the book at your computer console, typing in the commands to see what they do, then trying different things and seeing how they break. You are a scientist, which means that you develop a hypothesis, plan an experiment, collect data from your experiment, revise your hypotheses from the results of your experiment, and repeat these steps.</p>

        <p>Lisp Indentation: Properly indented Lisp code is easy to read. Unfortunately, many text editors do not know how to indent Lisp code. This means that the programmer needs to do it manually. Here are some rules. The first rule will work half the time -- INDENT A LINE AFTER UNMATCHED PARENTHESIS TWO SPACES. Here is an example:

        <pre>
(defun my-function (argument-1 argument-2)    ;unmatched parenthesis, indent next line two spaces
  (format t "the arguments are ~a and ~a~%")  ;matched parenthesis, do not indent next line
  (+ argument1 argument2))                    ;ending line, place all closing parenthesis at end of line
        </pre>

        The second rule with work the remaining half of the time -- INDENT ALL COMMON OBJECTS AT THE SAME LEVEL. Here are two examples:

        <pre>
(let ((a 4)             ;beginning of block
      (b 6)             ;indent b directly under a
      (c (+ a b)))      ;indent c directly under b
  )                     ;unmatched parenthesis on first line, see FIRST RULE

(if (= a b)                                               ;IF branch tests whether a is equal to b
    (format t "a is ~a, b is ~a, and they are equal")     ;THEN branch, indented directly under test
    (format t "a is ~a, b is ~a, and they are not equal"));ELSE branch, indented directly under test
        </pre>
        
        <p><b>Answers</b> A <i>variable</i> is a named piece of memory that holds a value. A <i>function</i> is a named block of code that (optionally) takes inputs and returns outputs. A Lisp command that <i>returns a value</i> means that, when the command completes its task, it gives some value back to the system. For example, an arithmetic command will give an answer, but a command to delete a variable would return either TRUE or FALSE, (or 1 or 0) depending on whether or not the variable was successfully deleted. That this is true for every command in Lisp is significant, and you should always remember it.</p>
