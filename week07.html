        <h1>Programming Lisp Course Page - Week 7</h1>

        <h3>Read <i>Land of Lisp</i>, pages 103 through 114.</h3>

        <p>These few pages, Chapter 6.5 and the first pages of Chapter 7, cover the two most basic elements of Lisp. There really isn't much to learn here (except on a theoretical level). I want to place these two topics in context, but as to learning the language, this will not be too helpful.</p>

        <p>Barski notes that the <code>(lambda)</code> function is the basic function in Lisp. John McCarthy created Lisp as a practical implementation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus, which was a means of computing values by functions rather than operations. Lambda functions allow the programmer to create anonymous functions, small functions that have only one use and that can, and should, be written in the code rather than being created as named functions. Lambda functions are common in Lisp, and this week's homework has a number of them.</p>

        <p>Chapter 7 concerns lists, and in fact, the name LISP comes from <b>LIS</b>t <b>P</b>rocessor. Lists are fundamental in all programming languages. In fact, both computer software and hardware may be viewed as lists. A program is simply a list of commands that the computer executes. A computer (that is, a computational machine) is hardly an anything more than a series of electronic boxes that hold data. As a practical matter, programmers rarely use lists in actual programs, they use more sophisticated data structures, such as arrays, hashes, structs, objects, modules, libraries, and so on. However, all these higher structures are built on top of lists. Your homework this week works with lists.</p>
