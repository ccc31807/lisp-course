        <h1>Programming Lisp Course Page - Week 14</h1>

        <h3>No reading assigned</h3>

        <p>This week is a challenge. There is no assigned reading. There is no class. There is a programming assignment, which will take a lot of thought and maybe ten hours of coding, maybe more. The purpose of this is to give you a significant programming task. This will stretch your abilities and skills, and if you complete it, you will feel a greatgg sense of accomplishment. If you have to peek at the answers, you will still get a great benefit if you understand what is going on in the code.</p>

        <p>The assignment consists of three pairs of problems, six in all. The first two problems require you to encrypt and decrypt a message with a simple substitution cipher. The second two problems require you to encrypt and decrypt a message with a multi-character cipher. The last two problems require you to encrypt and decrypt a message with a moving key, where each letter in the message has a key different than the previous letter. See the assignments for details.</p>

        <p><b>Plain text</b> means the text of the message in ordinary English -- anyone can read it. Another term you may see is <b>clear text</b>. <b>Encrypted text</b> is the coded message. In order to read a coded message, you need a <b>key</b> "unlock" to message, that is, to convert the coded message back to plain text. The process requires tow steps. First, the sender encrypts the message and sends it to the receiver. Then the receiver decrypts the coded text and reads the message. Both steps are necessary, and are mirror images of each other.</p> 

        <h3>Homework</h3>

                 <div style="background-color: #999999;">
        <p>Your homework is very difficult. The challenge is one of design, rather than coding. It asks you to write encryption and decryption programs -- a total of six. You will write three substitution ciphers, the first that encrypts plain text using a simple one character substitution, the second that uses a multi-character key, and the third a continuous key. It then asks you write decryption routines, one for each encryption routine. Before you write any code, you should encrypt and decrypt a sentence by hand, so you will understand how it works. I have uploaded my effort to this site as "cipher.lisp", but you should not look at it until you have thought about it a lot. This is a lot of work, but you will gain a sense of accomplishment when you succeed.<p>

        <p>Here is the output from my program.</p>
